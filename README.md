# simple pantry tracker app

nothing much to see here, just a very simple pantry tracker app made with Svelte and Firebase. Originally, HS recommended Next, but since I have had a fair amount of projects with the React framework, I figured I might as well take this opportunity to learn something new.

this is made with Svelte and Shadcn for the clean look, and Firebase for the backend. very good introduction, opened my eyes to see the power of concision that Svelte offers.
